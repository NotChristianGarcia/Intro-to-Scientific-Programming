Hello! This is the readme for my final project!
Name: Christian R. Garcia
EID: CRG2965

Instructions:
	There's a makefile with details included, but I'll also write things here.
	Simply use 'make RunAll' to create all the executables.
	They'll be named RunF0X, X being the exercise number associated with it.
	Just use ./RunF0X to run through the exercises.
	Feel free to use 'make superclean' to delete everything afterwards.

Hope you like it! Have a good day.
